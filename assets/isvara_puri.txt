Receiving the seed of Krishna prema from Madhavendra Puri, Shri Ishvara Puri became the spiritual master of Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. Madhavendra Puri couldn't move at the end of his life. So doing all humble services, Ishvara Puri even cleaned up his stool and urine. Ishvara Puri helped his guru to remember Shri Krishna by always chanting Hare Krishna and telling Radha-Krishna's pastimes. Pleasing Madhavendra Puri by these menial acts, Ishvara Puri received the treasure of Krishna-prema from his spiritual master.
 
   Shri Isvara Puri again showed exemplary humility, the ornament of a true Vaishnava, when he first met Shri Advaita Acharya. Finding Advaita Prabhu busy serving His Deity, Ishvara Puri sat down patiently and shyly. Although he was a Vaishnava sannyasi, Ishvara Puri introduced himself with, "I am a sudra of the lowest class."
 
   Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, the guru for the whole universe, honored Ishvara Puri by taking initiation from him. One day Ishvara Puri came to Lord Chaitanya's house. The Lord personally cooked and lovingly served His spiritual master. After Prasadam Lord Chaitanya rubbed sandalwood paste on Ishvara Puri and offered a fragrant flower garland. By His own example Shri Chaitanya showed how to properly worship and serve the guru-parampara.
 
   Once while passing through Shri Ishvara Puri's birth place Lord Gauranga became filled with rapture. Taking some dust the Lord said, "This dust is My life and soul." His samadhi stands in the 64 Samadhis Area.
