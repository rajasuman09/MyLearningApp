Shri Purushottama Dasa constantly meditated on and served the lotus feet of Lord Nityananda. Kanu Thakura, his son, was such an exalted Devotee that Lord Krishna always lived in his body. When Kanu was five Ma Jahnava took him to Vrindavana. The Goswamis joyously greeted him upon seeing his genuine devotion.
 
   In Goloka Vrindavana, Purushottama Dasa Thakura serves Lord Balarama as a cowherd boy, dvadasha gopala. His samadhi is located in the 64 Samadhis Area.
