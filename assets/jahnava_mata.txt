Shri Nityananda's two wives, Shri Vasudha and Shri Jahnava Devi, are expansions of Lord Balarama's eternal consorts Varuni and Revati. After the disappearance of the Pancha-tattva and many of Lord Chaitanaya's eternal associates, a huge sankirtana festival was held in Kheturi on Gaura-Purnima. Thousands of Lord Gauranga's followers such as Narottama, Shyamananda, Shrinivasa, Vrindavana Dasa, Murari Chaitanya, Parameshvara, and Miniketana Rama attended the first Kheturi Sankirtana Mahotsava.
   They celebrated Gauranga's appearance day with thunderous chanting, exuberant dancing, tasty Prasadam. Six sets of beautiful Deities were installed. Shri Jahnava Mata cooked a matchless feast and personally served all the Vaishnavas. During Narottama Dasa Thakura's prema nama kirtana, Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, Shri Nityananda Prabhu, and all Their associates suddenly appeared to the delight of all.
   Ma Jahnava, an affectionate name given by the Devotees, traveled throughout Gaura and Vraja mandalas. Wherever she went the Gaura bhaktas happily greeted and served her. Known as Nityananda-svarupini, Jahnava Devi overflowed with prema bhakti. She delivered many atheists and sinners by her compassionate preaching.
   Shrila Thakura Bhaktivinoda offers this prayer to Jahnava Mata in Kalyana-kalpa-taru: "0h Jahnava Devi! By the power of your divine qualities, be merciful to this servant of yours. Dispel this illusion which torments me. And relieve me of material existence. Let me take shelter at your lotus feet. You are Nityananda-sakti, the divine energy of Lord Nityananda Himself. You are the guru of Krishna bhakti. Be merciful to me and grant me the shade of your lotus feet, which are like a desire tree. You have delivered countless abominable sinners. Please deliver me in the same way. Today, praying for your mercy, this lowly sinner falls at your holy feet."
   It is said that Shri Jahvana Devi left this world by entering the Deity of Gopinatha in Vrindavana.
