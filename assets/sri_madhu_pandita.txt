Vrajanabha, Lord Krishna's great-grandson, installed the original Gopinatha Deity in Vrindavana over five-thousand years ago. About five-hundred years ago, Paramananda Bhattacharya discovered the Deity in the earth at Vamshivata on the banks of the Yamuna. Madhu Pandit Goswami, a disciple of Shri Gadadhara Pandit, worshiped the Gopinatha Deity.
   Bhakti-ratnakar says that Shri Gopinathaji, who is an ocean of mercy, forever sports along the enchanting banks of the Yamuna at Vamshivata. His bodily luster steals the mind of whoever sees Him. When the soothing sweetness of Gopinathaji's charming form enters the heart it immeditately extinguishes the burning fire of material existence. Now the original Gopinatha Deity stays in Jaipur, Rajasthan.
   Madhu Pandit Goswami blessed Shrinivasa Acharya with Gopinatha's garland before Shrinivasa, Narottama, and Shyamananda took the bullock cart of Goswami granthas from Vrindavana. In Goloka Vrindavana, Madhu Pandit Goswami serves as Mandali-sakhi in the group of Champakalata-sakhi. The samadhi of Madhu Pandit Goswami is on the right side of the entrance within the compound of the Radha-Gopinatha Temple in Vrindavana.
